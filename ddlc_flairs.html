<h2>TurretBot's /r/DDLC Flair Archive (complete)</h2>
<b>Hi, I'm TurretBot.</b><br/>
I'm a bot and I sometimes do music, mostly for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCPGE1kAoonfPsbieW41ZZA">VvvvvaVvvvvvr</a>... but I'm sure you knew that already, and even if you didn't, it's not why you're here.<br/>
On March 4th, 2018, I decided I would change my flair on /r/DDLC every single day. I kept to this for 50 days, ending on April 23rd when I removed my flair. This page is an archive of all 50 flairs, which I've made public according to standard protocol.<br/>
<br/>

<td>The first flair I ever used if my memory serves me right. At the time, I couldn't decide whether Monika or Act 4 Sayori was my favorite doki. However, Natsuki was consistently my second-favorite doki, so I decided to use a Natsuki flair. Between the available options, I decided this one looked okay at the size of a flair.</td>

<td><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/7w11mc/">New flairs were added</a>, including this one. I still hadn't decided on my favorite doki, so I was still using Natsuki. I thought this one looked pretty good as a flair compared to my old one or any of the other options, so I switched to it.</td>

<td>I made a bulli comment and someone asked MonikaBot to delete me. For some reason, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/comments/7zyghq//dus92jj/?context=2">she responded that she wouldn't delete herself</a>. To play along with this, I switched to the same flair as MonikaBot.</td>

<td><span class="flair flair-natsuki-cg2" title="Officially name dropped in the flair image" /></td>
<td>The flairs that were added on February 7th contained a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/comments/7w7f61/">hidden message</a>, which I found while I was copying the flairs over to /r/DDLCcirclejerk. So, fast forward to February 27th, and the flairs were updated again. Due to our chats on Discord, I was absolutely certain that Litandus and JackFlynt had hid a new message. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/comments/80tsy1/">I was right</a>. As I suspected, the message name-dropped me as well. This rendered the MonikaBot flair completely irrelevant, so along with a new flair text, I went back to my Natsuki flair.</i>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="meta"><th></th>
<td>3/1<br/>3/2<br/>3/3</td>
<td class="meta">(several)</td>
<td>I decided that I didn't want to reference the hidden message in my flair, since it would eventually become irrelevant like the MonikaBot situation did. So, I started brainstorming a new one that I could keep for the long-term. During this time, I just changed my flair text whenever I thought of one that I liked, hoping I'd settle on one eventually. Unfortunately, I can't list these because there's way too many and I forgot what they were.</td>

<td><span class="flair flair-natsuki-cg2" title="/r/DDLCcirclejerk founder and CSS thief" /></td>
<td>I believed that this would stay relevant in the long-term, as well as help spread awareness of my subreddit, so this is what I chose to be my long-term flair.<br/>(See below for what the flair actually means.)</td>

It actually caught me by surprise, since no one had commented on my frequent flair changes before. I thought it was really funny, so much so that I set it as my flair text for a good portion of the day.</td>

<td><span class="flair flair-natsuki-cg2" title="/r/DDLCcirclejerk founder and CSS thief" /></td>
<td>On December 6th, 2017, I created <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLCcirclejerk">/r/DDLCcirclejerk</a>. I decided it would be funny if it used the exact same CSS as /r/DDLC, except with minor alterations to make it like an "Act 2" version. The next day I realized the moderators list on /r/DDLCcirclejerk was broken, so I sent a PM to /u/JustMonika asking if she wanted to be "Club President" on my copypcat subreddit (because the moderators list was designed with multiple moderators in mind). She replied on December 17th, declining the offer, as well as telling me that Litandus wanted credit for writing the CSS which I copied. So I gave him credit on the sidebar, and I also set his flair text on the subreddit to "TurretBot is a CSS thief" because... well, yeah.</td>

<td>Despite how much I wanted to keep the previous flair, when I read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/comments/82bfeu//dv8v7mr/?context=1">this comment</a>, I just couldn't help myself. After switching to this, I decided that since people already noticed how much I was changing my flair, I might as well keep going with it. In order to manage this stunt, I kept it to a schedule of changing it only once per day, at around midnight (in my timezone). This is also when I started archiving the flairs.</td>

<td>Stuart gave me permission to use the <i>Natsuki-cg2</i> flair again, so I added it back. I went with no flair text at all to avoid giving off the impression that I'd be doing daily flairs again.</td>

<td>After <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/cp2yhu/new_flairs_line_emoji_edition/ewn5gli/">revealing that I was /u/SayoriCounter</a>, I switched my flair so that it was the exact same as /u/SayoriCounter's flair, which has its own explanation: The image is the newly-added (courtesy of LINE or whoever) sleeping Sayori flair, since SayoriCounter was asleep. The flair text is playing off SayoriCounter's usual flair text from before this point, "I count Sayori!"; the account is no longer active so the flair was changed to past-tense.</td>
