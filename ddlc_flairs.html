<h2>How did this happen?</h2>
<p>
Let's start from the beginning...
<br/><br/>
On December 6th, 2017, I created <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLCcirclejerk">/r/DDLCcirclejerk</a>. I decided it would be funny if it used the exact same CSS as /r/DDLC, except with minor alterations to make it like an "Act 2" version. The next day I realized the moderators list on /r/DDLCcirclejerk was broken, so I sent a PM to /u/JustMonika asking if she wanted to be "Club President" on my copypcat subreddit (because I figured it would be easier to fix the moderators list if there were two moderators). She replied on December 17th, declining the offer, as well as telling me that Litandus wanted credit for writing the CSS which I copied. So I gave him credit on the sidebar, and I also set his flair text on the subreddit to "TurretBot is a CSS thief" because... well, yeah. Since then, Litandus and I have had an... <i>interesting</i> relationship.
<br/><br/>
<!--The first flair I used, as far as I can remember, was natsuki1 (I don't remember when I started using it though).-->
When <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/7w11mc/">new flairs were added to /r/DDLC on February 7th, 2018</a>, I <!--switched to the new addition natsuki-cg2. I also--> wanted to copy the new flairs to /r/DDLCcirclejerk, so I took the flair image... and there was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/comments/7w7f61/">a hidden message</a>. A few weeks later, on February 24th, I made a bulli comment and someone asked MonikaBot to delete me. For some reason, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/comments/7zyghq//dus92jj/?context=2">she responded that she wouldn't delete herself</a>. To play along with this I switched to monika-cg3, the same flair as MonikaBot.
On Febuary 28th, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/comments/80swlb/">custom flair text for non-mods was added</a>. At first I simply set my flair text to "Is actually /u/MonikaBot", further referencing the MonikaBot incident. But I figured there would be a new hidden message in the flair image, so I checked it. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/comments/80tsy1/">I was right</a>, and the new message name-dropped me, too. After posting about it, I decided this was much more notable than the MonikaBot thing, so I set my flair to "Officially name dropped in the flair image" and switched the image back to natsuki-cg2. The next day I decided I didn't really like that flair text either since it would eventually become irrelevant like the MonikaBot one, so I started brainstorming a new one that I could keep for a while. So for the next few days I kept changing my flair whenever I thought of one that I liked, hoping I'd settle on one eventually.
<br/><br/>
Then, on March 3rd, I finally decided that my long-term flair text would be "/r/DDLCcirclejerk founder and CSS thief"... but that all changed when Fwort <a href="https://www.reddit.com/comments/81zpse//dv6f3z0/?context=1">called me</a> "person who changes their flair text the most often". I thought that was hilarious (and true), so I set his exact words as my flair text for a good portion of the day. Then, I switched back and I was ready to be done with it. But then on March 4th, I saw yet another quote I wanted to set as my flair text. It was at this point I decided to just change my flair text every single day instead of sticking to a single one. The chart above picks up from this point, starting with the quote I saw.
<br/><br/>
As a thank you to /r/DDLC for getting me to 25,000 karma, I've made this flair text archive public! (But only up to March 16th for now...)
<br/>
And I'm still changing my flair text every single day! Usually I change my flair right around midnight in my timezone (EST); failing that I change it when I wake up in the morning.
